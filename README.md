Doing a ```npm install``` in the project folder should install all the dependencies and create a folder called ```node_modules```. <br>

The folder ```views``` contains all the ```.ejs``` files. Similarly the folder ```style``` contains ```.css``` files corresponing to the ejs files. ```models``` folder contains schema for entities required to be stored in the database. ```routes``` folder contains the server side functions for different routes that are required and declared in ```index.js```.
